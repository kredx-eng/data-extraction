This code extracts IFSC and Account Number from the image of a cheque. 
It first pre-processes the image, then through the Google Vision API gets the JSON file of image and then from that through regex gets the IFSC and through a few possible cases finds the Account Number.

In the file two changes need to be made. 
1) Change the path of the Google Vision API Credentials file.
2) Change the path of the image of the cheque for the data to be extracted.
